# Creeps (card game)

_Creeps_ is a single-player card game inspired by Warcraft III. It borrows several gameplay elements from [Duel 52](https://juddmadden.com/duel52/) (designed by Judd Madden and Nina Riddell) and from [Mercenaries](https://github.com/spycherf/mercenaries). It requires a standard 52-card French-suited deck, plus 2-3 jokers (or any small household objects as substitutes). A game typically lasts about 20 minutes.

## Setting

The game is set on Azeroth, shortly before the Third War. In the human kingdom of Lordaeron, scattered bands of marauders—dubbed _creeps_ by frightened citizens—have been sighted roaming the countryside, pillaging towns and villages. Troubled by these incursions, King Terenas dispatches his forces to restore order and defend the realm from this growing menace...

## Rules

The game rules are found in the `creeps_game_rules.md` file. A variant of the game, the Kalimdor campaign, is planned for future release.
